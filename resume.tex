\section{Objective}
Help people, learn new things, and enjoy my time doing it.

\section{Skills}
\begin{itemize}
  % \small
  \item Languages: Golang, Clojure, PHP
  \item Tools/Infrastructure/Software: Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Vault, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis, Grafana, and various AWS services
\end{itemize}

\section{Work Experience}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{13cm}}
 \emph{Current} & Site Reliability Engineering Manager at \textsc{Guaranteed Rate} \\
 \textsc{Oct 2020} &
 \footnotesize{Continued my previous tasks from when I was on the DevOps team plus mentored a developer (who was fresh out of college) to the point where they became an actively contributing member of the DevOps team.}
 \\
 \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 \textsc{Oct 2020} & DevOps Engineer at \textsc{Guaranteed Rate} \\
 \textsc{Feb 2019} &
 \footnotesize{Maintained, upgraded, and standardized infrastructure used by the development organization while fielding support requests from our developers.}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \footnotesize{Deployed an upgraded version of Elasticsearch (v5 -> v7). Benefits: improved stability, retired 5 services supporting the old ES which were now unnecessary, consolidated multiple elasticsearch deployments into one, added alerting, automated a portion of the upgrade process and wrote documentation on how to upgrade (which a teammate successfully followed!)}
 \item \footnotesize{Fixed an intermittent DNS issue on our old 1.8 k8s clusters where DNS requests from our apps would intermittently time out after 5 seconds which caused stability issues}
 \item \footnotesize{Conducted technical and behavioral interviews for potential candidates}
 \item \footnotesize{Tried to improve open source software by creating detailed issues when I encountered bugs: https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/19902, https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26513}
 \item \footnotesize{Fielded support requests from the IT organization such as:}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \footnotesize{Developer asked why their lambda was failing to talk to the outside world. Turns out they had selected an AWS security group with no egress rules}
   \item \footnotesize{Developer requested to pair on writing terraform for their infrastructure}
   \item \footnotesize{Security asked if an EC2 instance could be terminated. I looked at VPC flow logs to make this determination}
   \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 \\
 \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 \textsc{Feb 2019} & Software Engineer II at \textsc{CareerBuilder} \\
 \textsc{Jan 2017} &
 \footnotesize{Continued developing new features and maintaining the infrastructure around our applicant tracking system (ATS)}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \footnotesize{Traveled to India to train the new development team so they could work on our ATS.}
   \item \footnotesize{Created microservices to expand the ability of the ATS (Cangrade assessments)}
   \item \footnotesize{Cleaned up technical debt (upgraded golang versions for our APIs, upgraded our software to use CircleCI 2.0, refactored older projects to match the structure of newer ones, etc...)}
 \end{itemize}
 \\
 \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 \textsc{Jan 2017} & Software Engineer I at \textsc{CareerBuilder} \\
 \textsc{Oct 2015} &
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \footnotesize{Developed software which managed our applicant tracking system's (ATS) life cycle (creation, deployment, upgrades, deletions)}
   \item \footnotesize{Created a feature flag API, which was consumed by the ATS, to enable faster development of features while reducing the number of bugs that end users see}
 \end{itemize}
 \\
 \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 \textsc{Oct 2015} & Integration Software Developer at \textsc{CareerBuilder} \\
 \textsc{Aug 2014} &
 \footnotesize{Edited XML files to configure certain behaviors of our applicant tracking system (ATS). Ended up learning and writing vimscript (thanks https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/!!) to automate some of the more repetitive configurations}

\section{About me}
I enjoy doing most things as long as I have good people to do them with! Some fun things I've done:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ran the 2019 Chicago marathon
  \item Jumped out of a perfectly good airplane (i.e. skydived)
  \item Raced on a sailboat during the summer of 2020
\end{itemize}

On weekends you might find me cooking while listening to movie soundtracks or playing guitar.
